## Boolean Operators

| Operator | Explanation                                                  | Example              |
| :------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
|   `+`    | Addition                                                     |                      |
|   `-`    | Subtraction                                                  |                      |
|   `*`    | Mutiplication                                                |                      |
|   `/`    | Division                                                     |                      |
|   `%`    | Modulus (나눈 것의 나머지)                                   | 5%2 = 1              |
|   `**`   | Exponentiation (제곱)                                        |                      |
|   `+=`   | Adds the value afterwards                                    | x += 3  →  x = x + 3 |
|   `==`   | Equals (Compares two items and reture `true` or `false`)     |                      |
|   `!=`   | Not Equals  (Compares two items and reture `true` or `false`) |                      |
|   `:`    | Tells the computer that what's coming next is what should be executed if the condition is met |                      |
|   `>`    | greater than                                                 |                      |
|   `>=`   | greater than or equal to                                     |                      |
|   `<`    | less than                                                    |                      |
|   `<=`   | less than or equal to                                        |                      |
|  `and`   | Two expressions NEED to be TRUE to be TRUE                   |                      |
|   `or`   | One of the expressions NEED to be TRUE to be TRUE            |                      |
|  `not`   | Reverse value of `and`                                       |                      |
|   `if`   | `if` statements can be used to create control flow in your code |                      |
|  `else`  | `else` statements can be used to execute code when the conditions of an `if` statement are not met |                      |
|  `elif`  | Checks another condition after the previous `if` statement conditions are not met. **Used to control the corder we want our program to check each of our conditional statements** |                      |



## List Methods

|       Methods        | Explanation                                                  | Example         |
| :------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
|     `.append()`      | adding an element at the end of the list                     |                 |
|         `+`          | this is combing two lists together (must be list). Example will print `[1,2,3,7]` | `[1,2,3] + [7]` |
|     `.remove()`      | remove an element that first appears that you have written in the method |                 |
|      `.count()`      | A list method to count the number of occurrences of an element in a list |                 |
|      `insert()`      | A list method to insert an element into a specific index of a list |                 |
|       `pop()`        | A list method to remove an element from a specific index or from the end of a list |                 |
|       `len()`        | A built-in Python function to get the length of a list       |                 |
| `.sort() / sorted()` | A method and a built-in function to sort a list              |                 |
